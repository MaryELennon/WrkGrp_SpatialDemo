## Overview

This repo was created for AECOM's Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Working Group Meeting on December 20th, 2018. The author hopes that the code and documentation provided here will act as both a basic Introduction to 'R' and offer supplementary workflows for differing tasks involving spatial data. Traditionally, tasks involving spatial data would be completed in a GIS. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are, “a specialist information technology (IT) used for handling mapped data” (Burrough, McDonnell, & Llyod, 2015). The most popular of these systems is ESRI's ArcGIS, a gooey interface for managing and visualizing spatial data. Increasingly, GIS related tasks are accomplished in a coding environment such as ‘R’ or ‘Python’. For those who are familiar with GIS technologies and software - this is different than coding in an ArcPy console.

Although, there are certain GIS tasks that are better suited for a traditional GIS environment, there are many that are best to R or the Conda environment for Python. The control and reproducibility, offered in the coding environment, is leaps and bounds ahead of anything a traditional GIS can do. As capabilities around spatial data manipulation and analysis in R increase more people, GIS Specialists and Novices, are looking to use R as a GIS.

The contents of this repo are very simplistic but I hope any user enjoys getting their feet wet!!!!

## New to the 'R' Programming Language?
If you are an employee at AECOM you will need Temp Admin to complete the following installations.

**Install R**

1) Download R from http://cran.us.r-project.org/.
2) Click on Download R for Windows. Click on 'install R for the first time' under Base.
3) Download the most recent version.
4) Install R. Leave all default settings in the installation options.

**Install RStudio**

2) Click on "Download RStudio Desktop."
3) Click on the version recommended for your system. Leave all default settings.
